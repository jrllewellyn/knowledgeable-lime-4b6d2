A good public relations strategy is something I am passionate about - from social media platforms, to newsletters, to radio, print, and television outreach - all are important parts of the vision an organization wants to extend to their constituents. I have years of experience writing press releases, creating timelines for effective public relations, implementing strategies to engage new volunteers, and exciting the media to take a second look at the wonderful things your organization is doing to help the community. Of all the things that seem important to effectively managing a nonprofit, a well-vetted public relations strategy is crucial to an organization's success and I absolutely adore helping a new or small nonprofit bloom!
