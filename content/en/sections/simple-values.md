It may sound counter-intuitive, but there really is more to fund development than just raising money! Identifying fundraising sources, building lasting donor relationships, keying on the organization's objectives and ideals help determine the success of fundraising campaigns, as well as helping to provide a long term and stable foundation as organizations grow and change. Small organizations may initially lack staff to do this very important step effectively and hiring a consultant may provide the best way to bridge the gap between a small staff and finding the money needed to grow and hire fund development professionals within the organization.
