The goal of any nonprofit is to provide a service and value to the community. To reach this goal, organizations have to rely on a well-structured and efficient staff, a motivated and dedicated board of directors, and enthusiastic volunteers. I have over two decades of helping small and grassroots organizations take a look at the best way to implement effective (and efficient!) board and staff organization to get the most out of busy volunteers and hard-working professionals.
