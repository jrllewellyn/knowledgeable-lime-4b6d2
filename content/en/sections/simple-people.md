Special events are a common and exciting fundraising tool for nonprofits of all sizes. While generating revenue is important (and I have a proven track record of always exceeding a realistic special event fundraising financial goal), building a broad base of donors and volunteers and creating public awareness is equally critical. Organization is key to success and I LOVE all the minutiae of event planning. Logistics management is key and creating a welcoming, exciting, and deliverable special event is what I do best.
